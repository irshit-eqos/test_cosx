# Pre-Push Hook Documentation

## Overview

This repository includes a pre-push Git hook that automatically runs tests before allowing code to be pushed to the remote repository.

## How It Works

The pre-push hook (`.git/hooks/pre-push`) will:

1. **Check for Node.js**: Verifies that Node.js is installed
2. **Check for test file**: Looks for `test.js` in the project root
3. **Run tests**: Executes `node test.js`
4. **Block push if tests fail**: Prevents push if any test fails
5. **Allow push if tests pass**: Proceeds with push if all tests pass

## Test File

The hook runs `test.js` which contains your test suite. You can modify `test.js` to include your actual tests.

## Usage

### Normal Push (Tests Pass)
```bash
git push
# Hook runs tests automatically
# If tests pass → push proceeds
```

### Push Blocked (Tests Fail)
```bash
git push
# Hook runs tests automatically
# If tests fail → push is blocked
# Fix tests and try again
```

## Bypassing the Hook (Not Recommended)

If you absolutely need to bypass the hook (e.g., for emergency hotfixes):

```bash
git push --no-verify
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Only use `--no-verify` in exceptional circumstances. It defeats the purpose of the hook.

## Customizing Tests

Edit `test.js` to add your own tests:

```javascript
test('Your test name', () => {
  assert.strictEqual(actual, expected, 'Error message');
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Hook not running?
- Ensure the hook is executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push`
- Verify the hook exists: `ls -la .git/hooks/pre-push`

### Tests failing?
- Run tests manually: `node test.js`
- Check test output for specific errors
- Fix failing tests before pushing

### Node.js not found?
- Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/
- Verify installation: `node --version`

## Reinstalling the Hook

If the hook gets deleted or you need to reinstall it:

```bash
# Copy the hook script to .git/hooks/
cp pre-push .git/hooks/pre-push
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
```
